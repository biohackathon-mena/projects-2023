## Title: 

mOWL: Python library for machine learning with biomedical ontologies

## Description:

Ontologies are widely used in machine learning methods as source of
background knowledge. mOWL is a Python library designed to work with
ontologies as primary source of data. We implemented methods and
funcionalities to integrate ontologies with machine learning
methods. mOWL, in general, is composed by the following frameworks:

1. **Ontology management**: normalization and reasoning, interfacing
   with the OWL API and automated reasoners

2. **Ontology transformation**: including methods for projecting
ontologies into graphs, text corpora, or other formats used as
precursor to machine learning;

3. **Embedding generation**: by interfacing with the knowledge graph
embedding library PyKEEN and other approaches
implemented in Python; and

4. **Embedding post-processing**: including axiom inference, node
classification, evaluation, and visualization.

The last version of mOWL is 0.1.1. The new version is under development. For this hackathon, we have a list of potential areas in which to work on:

* **Implementation of an inference module**: This component consists on generating a general framework that computes plausability of axioms based on a embedding method.
* **Improve visualization of embeddings**: This task is focused on developing a framework to generate visual representations of learned entity embeddings.
* **Implement new methods**: We will be working on the implementation of [Box2EL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11118), a brand new method to embed EL++ description logic.


All of our milestones for the next mOWL version can be found at: https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/mowl/milestones

mOWL documentation is available a https://mowl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

We will be happy to get new collaborators to work and learn.
