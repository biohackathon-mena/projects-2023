# Project 19

## Title:

Agile textmining with PubAnnotation/PubDictionaries, and its application to MENA Bioinformatics

## Description:

Agile textmining is an iterative approach to textmining about which [a paper was published in 2019](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz227).

PubAnnotation/PubDictionaries/TextAE are web-based resources developed for agile textmining.

During BioHackathon MENA 2023, the goal of Project 19 is to find a good application case of agile textmining, and to implement it, which will include
- developing a collection of documents
- developing a dictionary
- developing an annotation
- exporting the annotation into RDF, and make it searchable.
